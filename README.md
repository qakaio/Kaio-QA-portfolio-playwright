# 🧪 AutomationExercise Test Suite (Playwright + JavaScript)

This project contains a complete automated test suite using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) with JavaScript, covering **26 Test Cases** from the [AutomationExercise](https://www.automationexercise.com/) website.

Built by [Kaio Garcia](https://github.com/qakaio) as part of my QA Automation portfolio.

This repository uses GitHub Actions CI/CD, running daily at 09:00 and 21:00 UTC, executing all tests inside a containerized environment based on the official Playwright Docker image.

Tests run inside mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.53.1-noble

Browsers and system dependencies are preinstalled

Fully reproducible and deterministic execution

No environment drift between local and CI runs

After each execution, an HTML test report is generated and automatically published via GitHub Pages:
